## 1. What this project is

A 2D, **Godot**-built, turn-based RPG in the *Redwall* tradition (anthropomorphic
woodlanders vs. vermin; all-ages with real stakes). **The hook: every random combat
resolution is a SLOT-REEL SPIN, not a dice roll — and the player's build edits the reels**
(which symbols, how many reels, what each symbol does).

Campaign mode is built **first**. A roguelite mode comes post-1.0 and reuses the same systems.

**Current goal:** a vertical-slice prototype — 1 player character vs. 1 enemy, placeholder
rectangles for art — proving this loop: Initiative spin → fixed-order round → MTG-style
phase turn → Action-reel attack (each reel resolves independently) → damage via type chart
→ Bonus Meter charges → win/lose check. **The moment that loop is fun with ugly art, the game is real.**

---

## 2. Engine & language — non-negotiable

- **Engine: Godot 4.6+** (project is built/tested on **4.6.3-stable**).
- **Language: GDScript. NOT C#.** Do not introduce C# files, the .NET build, or C#-only patterns.
- **Data objects are `Resource`-based** so they're editable in the Godot inspector
  (`ReelFace`, `Reel`, `Weapon`, `DamageType`, `Effect`, `Class`, etc. — see `DESIGN.md` §8).
- Prefer **static typing** in GDScript (typed vars, typed function signatures) for legibility and tooling.
- Use **signals** for decoupling combat events — see the canonical signal list below
  (`spin_resolved`, `damage_applied`, `meter_charged`, `turn_ended`, …).

### Naming conventions (LOCKED — use these everywhere)

These are the project-wide standard. New code (and the eventual rewrite of the legacy
slot-machine scripts) MUST follow them. `DESIGN.md` is still the source of truth for the
*design*; this section is the authoritative list for *names*.

- **Classes / Resources:** `PascalCase` — `Reel`, `InitiativeReel`, `ActionReel`, `ReelFace`,
  `Combatant`, `TurnManager`, `PhaseManager`, `BonusMeter`, `Ultimate`, `ResourcePool`.
- **Script files:** `snake_case` matching the class — `reel.gd`, `initiative_reel.gd`,
  `action_reel.gd`, `turn_manager.gd`.
- **Signals:** `snake_case`, **past-tense**, naming the event that *occurred* (the `spin_resolved`
  standard). **Never** prefix the signal itself with `on_`. Canonical combat events:
  `spin_started`, `spin_resolved`, `face_resolved`, `initiative_rolled`,
  `damage_applied`, `meter_charged`, `turn_ended`.
- **Signal handlers:** `_on_<emitter>_<signal>` — e.g. `_on_reel_spin_resolved`
  (Godot's standard connect convention; the `on_` lives on the handler, not the signal).
- **Nodes:** `PascalCase` (Godot default). *(Lightly held — confirm if a scene layout pushes back.)*

### Reel class hierarchy (LOCKED)

Reels are an abstract base `Resource` with two subclasses — **not** one class with a `kind` enum
(the two kinds carry genuinely different face data, so a shared enum would force an overloaded
`ReelFace` and `if kind == …` branching):

- **`Reel`** (base, `Resource`) — common contract: an ordered `faces` array and `spin() -> ReelFace`.
  Not instantiated directly.
- **`InitiativeReel`** (`extends Reel`) — faces are **digits 0–9**; percentile convention
  (`00` reads as 100). This reel is a **constant shared by every combatant** — authored once
  as a single `.tres` and reused, per §4.2.
- **`ActionReel`** (`extends Reel`) — faces are **result tiers** (critfail/fail/neutral/success/
  critsuccess) carrying a `multiplier` + optional `rider_effect_id`. Instances **vary** by
  weapon/class/talent/gear — this is the build-expression layer.

> **STILL TODO (not yet decided — do not guess):** folder/scene structure. ASK before writing
> code that depends on it.

## 3. The design pillars — don't let these drift

1. **The slot reel IS the dice.** Every randomized combat resolution is a reel spin. Protect this.
2. **Builds edit the reels.** Class/race/gear/talents change which symbols are on a reel,
   how many reels you get, and what each symbol resolves to. This is the depth.
3. **Legibility over realism.** The player must always be able to see and reason about state
   (turn order, reel contents, what a symbol will do). Hidden math kills the fun.
4. **Every choice is a trade-off.** If an option is strictly best regardless of context, it's a design failure.
5. **Campaign first, fun first.** Prove the loop with placeholder art before building anything else.
   **Do not build any roguelite-specific system yet.**

## 4. Combat facts the code must respect

(Full detail in `DESIGN.md` §4. Summary so a session doesn't have to reconstruct it.)

- **Initiative:** each combatant rolls **once** via a 2-reel d100 spin (reel 1 = tens, reel 2 = ones).
  Percentile convention: **`00` reads as 100** (the high/critical roll), `01` is the true minimum.
  Effective range 1–100, uniform. Surface this clearly in UI — it's counterintuitive.
- **Turn order:** fixed-order rounds in **descending current-Initiative**. Store each combatant's
  **`current_initiative`** as the live sort key; effects modify that value **with a duration**.
  Turn order is always "sort by current_initiative, descending." Fast characters act earlier,
  they do NOT get extra turns.
- **Turn phases (MTG-style):** Upkeep → Main 1 (spend resources, set reel loadout) → Combat (spin)
  → Main 2 → End.
- **Action reels:** **2–5** per turn (baseline 2 = heavy/big-spell, typical 3, high-end 5 = light/rapid).
  Main-Phase abilities **add or subtract** reels from the weapon baseline — **additive, never overwrite.**
- **Each reel resolves as an INDEPENDENT attack.** No aggregation. Damage =
  `Σ (weapon_base_damage × that reel's multiplier) + modifiers`, then apply the type chart.
- **5 result tiers per reel:** crit-fail / fail / **neutral (utility, no damage, +1 meter)** / success / crit-success.
- **6 damage types:** Slashing, Piercing, Crushing, Storm, Mystic, Earth. Gentle spread
  (×0.75 / ×1.0 / ×1.25; rare ×0.5 / ×1.5). Chart is in `DESIGN.md` §5.1 — it's a lookup table.
- **Bonus Meter / Ultimate:** a SEPARATE economy from Stamina/Focus/Mana. The Ultimate costs
  ONLY its filled meter. Meter exists only for PCs and Elite/Boss enemies; enemy meters hidden by default.
  Per-class `meter_floor` carryover rule — see `DESIGN.md` §4.9.

> **Balance numbers are placeholders** (multiplier values, meter cap of 10, charge weights).
> They're flagged `[ASSUMPTION]` in `DESIGN.md`. **Do not "balance" them — they get tuned by
> playtest after the spin is fun.** Build them as easily-editable data, not hard-coded constants.

## 5. How we work (methodology)

This project uses the **superpowers** workflow. Honor it:

1. **Brainstorm / spec before code.** For any non-trivial feature, step back and confirm what
   we're building before writing it. Show the design in chunks I can actually read.
2. **Write a plan** of bite-sized tasks with exact file paths and verification steps.
3. **Test-driven where it makes sense.** Combat math (initiative roll range, multiplier sums,
   meter carryover) is pure logic — write tests first. Watch them fail, then make them pass.
4. **Review against the plan** between tasks; surface issues by severity.
5. **Git worktrees for parallel sessions.** If multiple Claude Code sessions run at once, each
   works on its own branch/worktree so they don't collide.

**The hard ceiling:** you (Claude Code) **cannot press play and judge whether the spin is fun.**
That call is mine. **Delegate implementation, not fun.** Build the loop; I decide if it feels right.

---

## 6. Specialist agents available

These agents are installed (`~/.claude/agents/`). Use them when the task fits:
- **Godot Gameplay Scripter** — GDScript systems, signals, scene composition, the combat loop.
- **Game Designer** — systems/economy questions (reel spreads, meter tuning) — design reasoning, not balance-by-fiat.
- **Narrative Designer** — lore, branching dialogue, world structure (post-prototype work).

---

## 7. Scope discipline

- Build **only** what the current task needs (YAGNI). No speculative systems.
- **No roguelite systems**, no permadeath wrapper, no meta-progression — that's post-1.0.
- Resist adding a 7th damage type, a 6th reel "just because," etc. Depth comes from interaction
  of few elements, not quantity.
- Prototype is built **1v1**, but architect `TurnManager`/UI for **N-vs-M** from day one
  (`current_initiative` already handles arbitrary combatant counts; party max is 3 PCs).

---

## 8. Status / next actions

(Keep this section updated as work progresses — it's the "where were we" anchor.)

- [x] `ARCHITECTURE.md` — as-built combat architecture + near-term combat stubs (Effect/Ultimate/ResourcePool).
- [x] Godot 4.6 project scaffolding (combat/ feature tree, naming convention locked in §2).
- [x] Combat data foundation: `ReelFace`, `Reel`/`InitiativeReel`/`ActionReel`, `DamageType`, `CombatResolver`.
- [x] Vertical-slice prototype loop (see §1 "Current goal") — code-complete, headless-verified.

**Done:**
- Foundation resources + `Weapon`, `Combatant`, `BonusMeter`, `TurnManager`, `PhaseManager`,
  and the `CombatResolver` independent-reel resolution — all under `res://combat/`.
- Playable `combat.tscn` (1 PC vs 1 enemy, placeholder rects): Initiative spin → fixed-order
  round → MTG phase turn → **player-driven** Spin → scrolling Action reels → independent
  per-reel damage via the 6-type chart → Bonus Meter charges/arms → win/lose + restart.
- 6 `DamageType` `.tres` (gentle placeholder chart, `[ASSUMPTION]`).
- Headless test suite under `tests/` — **20 suites, all green.** Run a test:
  `Godot_v4.6.3-stable_win64 --headless --path bunnies --script res://tests/test_<name>.gd`.
- **Ten combat systems** shipped this branch, all headless-test-green (each has a design spec in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/`; autonomous balance calls in `docs/superpowers/DECISIONS-LOG.md`):
  1. **Effect + Crushing→Slow** — `Effect` + `EffectLibrary` (`&"slow"` −20/2); `current_initiative`
     DERIVED; resolver REPORTS the rider, orchestrator APPLIES it (authority rule §2).
  2. **Stacking debuffs (merge-by-id)** — `attach_effect` merges by id; SLOW stacks −20/−10/−5 (cap
     −35) + refreshes; non-stacking effects just refresh.
  3. **ResourcePool** — Stamina-only (regen in Upkeep, spent in Main 1, on the panel).
  4. **Staged Main Phase 1 (`MainPhasePlan`)** — Splice / Fire-Ultimate toggles only PREVIEW; SPIN
     commits; `PhaseManager` pauses at Main 1.
  5. **Main-Phase Storm splice** — `try_splice_reel`: additive +1 typed reel, 2 STA, 5-reel cap,
     this-turn-only, excluded from the payline grid.
  6. **Sticky-Wild Ultimate (redesigned)** — costs the full meter (cap **15**); wilds **ALL weapon
     reels** crit-**biased ~65%** (not forced) for 2 spins.
  7. **Paylines** — `PaylineLibrary` + `PaylineResolver` score the 3×W weapon grid: crit line →
     bonus damage (`ceil`, length-scaled) + Inspirational buff (+5 init/2t); success → +1 meter;
     neutral → refund 1 STA. `extra_lines` hook reserved for Luck.
  8. **5+1 stats + Gear** — `Stats` (Might/Finesse/Vigor/Focus/Grit/Luck) + `Gear`; flat levers; the
     Finesse→d10 initiative tie-break; Luck adds crit faces (`apply_luck`). Martin: Padded Jerkin.
  9. **STUNNED** — start-of-turn init < −20 → STUNNED; Main-1 d100 gate (51+ recover / 01–50 lose);
     anti-lock (no two stunned turns in a row).
  10. **Reel-face shuffle** (balance-neutral) + **round-up (ceil)** all damage; window 1280×800,
      centered victory/defeat card.

**Verified-by-machine vs your call:** all logic + integration is test-green and the scene loads
without errors. **Whether the spin is *fun*, and whether the scrolling reels feel right, is the
human call (CLAUDE.md §5 hard ceiling)** — play `combat.tscn` and judge.

**Next — PAUSING combat engineering to design CONTENT.** The systems prove the loop; they now need
content to express. Design-first (per §5 and the combat-change standard procedure):
- **Flesh out races, classes + specializations, abilities, and buffs/debuffs.** These ride the
  deferred `DESIGN.md §8` world/meta classes (`Class`, `EncounterTable`, `RewardTable`, talents) —
  do not build them speculatively yet (§7 YAGNI).

When the content design is firmer, **RETURN to combat** to:
1. **Implement the new content into the existing systems** (new `Effect`s, Main-1 abilities, the
   other five Ultimate archetypes, Luck "+paylines" — all on existing hooks, not new architecture).
2. **Build full N-vs-M party combat** (everything is already party-ready — `current_initiative`,
   Inspirational-targets-all-allies, per-combatant effects/STUNNED; only the prototype *scenario* is
   1v1). Add party (max 3 PCs) vs. multi-enemy, target selection, and N-frame UI.

Also queued after the human play-test: tune all `[ASSUMPTION]` numbers (HP, base damage, charge
weights, chart, Slow −20/−10/−5, Stamina 3/5/+1, splice 2 STA, meter cap 15, wild bias 0.65, Luck
+1 face/pt, Jerkin stats, STUN −20); the future UI polish is recorded in `ARCHITECTURE.md §9`.
Full current snapshot: `HANDOFF.md`.
